# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 01 to 10


### Day 3: November, 16 - 2022 (Started Hibernate)

**Today's Progress**: Stored object to DB.

Installed MySQl. Followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR7-EdxDSf0) course from YouTube.

**Thoughts:** Found out what are POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) and why is a no-argument constructor required by Hibernate. 
Hibernate uses reflection to create an object, so it is necessary to have a no-argument constructor in POJO class.
