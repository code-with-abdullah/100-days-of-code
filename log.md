# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 01 to 10



### Day 7: November, 20 - 2022 (Wrote first REST controller using Spring Framework)

**Today's Progress**: Created a REST controller with Spring.

**Thoughts:** Found the difference between a simple controller and a REST controller. Simple controller returns object whereas REST controller returns a view.

### Day 6: November, 19 - 2022 (Started learning spring framework for Java App Development)

**Today's Progress**: The basic architecture of Spring.

**Thoughts:** Spring Framework really makes Java Development easy.

### Day 5: November, 18 - 2022 (Learnt using native queries via Hibernate)

**Today's Progress**: Read data from database using native HQL (Hibernate Query Language).
Followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR7-EdxDSf0) course from YouTube.

**Thoughts:** Found out the difference in get and load methods and the if an object is changed after call the save method and then commited the latest changes will be reflected in the database.

### Day 4: November, 17 - 2022 (Created relationships and learnt about eager and lazy loading used by Hibernate)

**Today's Progress**: Read data from database. Created one to one, one to many, many to many relationships in the database. 
Learnt about the loading techniques.
Followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR7-EdxDSf0) course from YouTube.

**Thoughts:** Found out about caching in Hibernate and that First Level Cache is by default enabled in Hibernate. If a query has to be run multiple times in the same session hibernate will only run it once.

### Day 3: November, 16 - 2022 (Hibernate Insertions to DB)

**Today's Progress**: Stored object to DB.

Followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR7-EdxDSf0) course from YouTube.

**Thoughts:** Found out what are POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) and why is a no-argument constructor required by Hibernate. 
Hibernate uses reflection to create an object, so it is necessary to have a no-argument constructor in POJO class.
